 🌟 WHY SEHAT SAATHI?

In many communities, healthcare information and mental wellness resources are often difficult to access or shrouded in stigma. **Sehat Saathi** (meaning "Health Companion") aims to:
- **Democratize Wellness**: Make health resources accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical background.
- **Multi-language Support**: Provide guidance in regional languages including Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Bhojpuri, and Maithili.
- **Reduce Stigma**: Offer a safe, digital space to explore wellness options and track symptoms.
- **Empower through Information**: Connect users with government schemes (Sarkari Yojana) and nearby medical facilities.
